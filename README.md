# todo-app
Hello guys! In this project I tried to create simple todo app. It has some features:
- adding todos, of course
- simple priorities system (if you choose 'High' or 'Highest' it will render this items with exclamation marks)
- simple filtration (by priority or status)
- setting date (also it will notify you if todo is overdue)
- saving to your localstorage 
- and a beautiful styles (it's a joke)
